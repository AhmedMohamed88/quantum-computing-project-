Project: Implement and Analyze Quantum Search Algorithms Using Qiskit
Project Description
Students will implement two quantum search algorithms— Grover’s Search Algorithm
and Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm— using Qiskit. They will compare these algorithms with
their classical counterparts to observe speedup and efficiency in solving specific
problems.
Learning Objectives
• Gain hands-on experience implementing quantum algorithms in Qiskit.
• Understand how quantum speedup works by comparing quantum and classical
solutions.
• Apply quantum gates and circuits to real-world problem-solving.
• Visualize quantum states and results using Qiskit tools.
Project Tasks
1. Introduction & Setup
o Install Qiskit and set up the environment.
o Review the necessary quantum gates (Hadamard, X, Z, CNOT, etc.).
2. Classical Baseline Implementation
o Implement a classical function to solve a search problem (e.g., unstructured
search for an element in a list).
o Implement a classical algorithm to determine if a function is balanced or
constant (for comparison with Deutsch-Jozsa).

3. Quantum Implementation
o Implement Grover’s algorithm in Qiskit to search for a specific marked
element.
o Implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in Qiskit.
o Simulate the circuits and obtain measurement results.

4. Analysis & Comparison
o Compare runtime and complexity between classical and quantum
approaches.
o Analyze the circuit depth and number of qubits used.
o Discuss practical challenges in quantum computation (e.g., noise,
decoherence).
5. Report & Presentation
o Prepare a short report explaining the methodology, results, and conclusions.
